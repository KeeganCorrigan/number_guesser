# number_guesser

Number guesser is a basic number guessing game hosted on github pages at:

https://keegancorrigan.github.io/numberguesser.github.io/

It is built using vanilla Javascript, html, and CSS. It includes the ability to clear the number field, reset the game, and input your own number range for guessing (the default range is 1 - 100). The game flow is fairly straightforward: you will be informed if the number you guessed is too high or too low. If you guessed correctly, a new random number will be generated (but the number range will increase by 20 and this CAN include negative numbers - remember, negative numbers are numbers too).
